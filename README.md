About

Keep track of your study habits as you work alongside classmates on an easy to use website. 

Our vision for the app is for it to be able to help students of RPI improve their productivity in their studies through interactive online collaboration and organization. The app would have a scheduler/planner integrated so that students can keep track of their daily and weekly activities. We want our product to be able to help keep track of study habits by timing out sessions and planning breaks and be able to use the data to analyze study patterns and give suggestions/study tips to users. In addition, students taking the same courses can collaborate for homework help exam preparation through virtual chat rooms. While other sites such as Piazza provide online study aid, our app is more than just a forum.
